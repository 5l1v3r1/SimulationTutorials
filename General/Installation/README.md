# Installation instructions

Below you find installation instructions for all the software used in our tutorials.
There are **two ways** you can go about this:
* Install [Virtualbox](#virtualbox) and download a VM from the relevant tutorial. 
This VM will have all the necessary software preinstalled.                
* Install the software yourself: Neuron, eFEL, BluePyOpt                         
                                                                                 
## VirtualBox                                                                    
                                                                                 
We provide Virtual Machines with preinstalled software.                          
To run these VMs it is necessary to install the [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) software.
