# Installation instructions

Below you find installation instructions for all the software used in our tutorials.
There are **two ways** you can go about this:
* Install [Virtualbox](#virtualbox) and download a VM from the relevant tutorial. 
This VM will have all the necessary software preinstalled.                
* Install the software yourself: Neuron, IPython notebooks, eFEL, BluePyOpt
