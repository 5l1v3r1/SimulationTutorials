The main part of this demo consists of :
* **Extracting electrical features from in vitro recordings**
* **Optimising parameters of a simple neuron model**
* **Exploring the microconnectomics in the [Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration (NMC) portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/microcircuit)**

This tutorial is presented by Elisabetta Iavarone (@ Blue Brain Project, Geneva, Switzerland)

## Virtual Machine

A **Google drive** was created with **material** for the tutorial:

https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B5FLVTgErnMSTm9JTk9FTFNCV2s

This drive contains a **Virtual Machine** (.ova file) that can be used to run the demoed software, donwload the file with "final" in the filename.

Please follow the **instructions** [here](https://github.com/BlueBrain/SimulationTutorials/tree/master/General/Installation) to install VirtualBox so that you can run the VM on your machine.

The **login information** for the VM: username=hbpschool2016 password=hbp2016

Please **ignore** all **update requests** from the OS inside the VM.

### FAQ

* if you get errors while running the VM regarding '64-bit' or 'VT-x', try to run the VM on the Google drive with '32bit' in the filename
* you might get an error about 'shared folder' when first opening the .ova file, you can ignore these.
* for people who chose the 'hard way' to install Neuron etc. There was an error in the instruction on how to test the Neuron installation (the test command didn't return -65 mV). This is now fixed in the instruction pages.
