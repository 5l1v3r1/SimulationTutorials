## Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal (NMC Portal)

This portal provides an online public resource of the Blue Brain Project's first release of a **digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry** of juvenile Rat somatosensory cortex, access to experimental data sets used in the reconstruction, and the resulting models.
