### Google drive

A **Google drive** was created with **extra material**

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5FLVTgErnMSc200LWFBQVMwOVU

This drive contains the **slides**, and a **Virtual Machine** that can be used to run the demoed software.

### Neuron simulator

The first part of the tutorial consists an introduction to the **Neuron simulator** itself.

Neuron simulator website: http://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/

### Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal (NMC Portal)

This portal provides an online public resource of the Blue Brain Project's first release of a **digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry** of juvenile Rat somatosensory cortex, access to experimental data sets used in the reconstruction, and the resulting models.

### eFEL

The **Electrophys Feature Extraction Library** (eFEL) allows neuroscientists to automatically extract features from time series data recorded from neurons (both in vitro and in silico). Examples are the action potential width and amplitude in voltage traces recorded during whole-cell patch clamp experiments. The user of the library provides a set of traces and selects the features to be calculated. The library will then extract the requested features and return the values to the user.

### BluePyOpt

The **Blue Brain Python Optimisation Library** (BluePyOpt) is an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and standardises several existing open-source tools. It simplifies the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established best-practices. Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up both small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures.
